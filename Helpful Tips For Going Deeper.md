# Helpful Tips for Going Deeper

<br>

## Introduction

This document covers some basic guidelines, tips, resources, and practical steps to help **intermediate** programmers become better programers. I hope it helps.

<br>

## General Thoughts

There are a number of different ways to get better at programming.

Basic paths for advancement:

- Using GML tutorials (difficult but not impossible)
- Going outside GML and learning another language
- Just keep making more and more complicated games or even just different games
- Read other people's code

<br>

## Using GML Tutorials

Learning anything particularly advanced in GML is somewhat difficult as most tutorials stop at a rather basic level. That said, there are a few out there that are cover more advanced topics:

- [Gloomy Toad Studios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmSLCkK6I5cONb-5N0v18Kw)

## Going outside GML and learning another language

Since there isn't a lot of indepth programming help inside of GML directly, it can be very beneficial to go outside of GML. Here are some resources I've used:

- [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath)
- [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?sort=dd&view=50&shelf_id=6)
- [Computer Science Playlist]()
- [A full Computer Science Degree](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
- [Udemy in General](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Books](https://samspadegamedev.com/dev-blog/f/programming-books-i-liked)

## Keep Making Games

Making games doesn't always help you learn in the most orderly way, but if it is what motivates you and keeps you programming, it could still be the best. A suggestion would be every time you start doing something new, look up some tutorials or classes on those specific elements. Here are some ideas:

- An action-driven game (e.g. platformer, runner, shmup, etc.)
- A data driven game (e.g. board game, turn based strategy, point and click adventure game, etc.)
- A marketplace asset (e.g. package something useful up)

<br>

## Read other people's code

There are a lot of amazing free and cheap assets on the marketplace. Find some that interest you, get them, and break them apart, try to understand them. Here are a couple free ones I recommend:

- [GMAssrt](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/8164/gmassert)
- [Array Functions](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/8736/array-functions)
- [Action-Platformer Engine 1](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/1093/action-platformer-engine-1)
- [FC's Dialogue System](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/6076/fc-s-dialogue-system)

<br>

## Conclusion

It probably isn't exactly correct to say that it doesn't matter what you do to learn, so long as you keep at it long enough, but it is closer than you think. In the end, there's no subsitute for just sticking with it. Find the things that motivate you and keep working.
