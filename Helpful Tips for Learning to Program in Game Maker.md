# Helpful Tips for Learning to Program in Game Maker

<br>

## Introduction

This document covers some basic guidelines, tips, resources, and practical steps for new programmers - especially for those of us who are doing it purely for fun (and potentially profit) without any prior coding experience or external motivation. The following list of guidelines, tips, resources, and practical steps is not meant to be exhaustive (or exhausting) and should serve only as a guideline. I hope it helps.

<br>

## Helpful Practical First Steps

- Follow a tutorial. Good beginning tutorials are those that cover an entire project or a significant portion of it. Links to a few are listed at the end. If you’re willing to pay a little money, there are a number of courses on Udemy that will be more structured and guaranteed to go from start to finish.

- Pick an idea you’re interested in and try to figure it out. Whether it’s a full game idea or just a concept, the jump right in approach works for many, but, as noted later, you probably want to start small. 

- Just start coding. It really doesn’t matter what so long as you’re interested in it.

## Helpful Guidelines

- Have fun and stay motivated. Right now you are probably extremely motivated. That’s great! Someday, you may not be. However coding is a skill and it doesn’t happen overnight. So you need at least some motivation (or discipline) to keep at it long enough to become capable of making your game ideas a reality.  

- Keep coding. As mentioned, coding is a skill. The longer you do at it, the better you’ll get. This is part of why it’s important to stay motivated. A little bit every day, or every week, or even just once in awhile but consistently is enough to improve over time. 

- Keep learning. If you’re just starting, everything is learning. However, at some point, you may be good enough to sort of make the thing you want. Don’t stop learning things then. Learn the things you want (or need), but also learn the basics. Unless you want to, don’t force yourself to watch dozens of hours of YouTube tutorials before making your first game. Do try to identify and learn the topics that come up over and over. Consider watching some of the many free YouTube computer science intro classes. A little time learning the fundamentals will go a long way.

- Keep your first projects small. While not the right advice for everyone, it’s the right advice for most. Small means you can finish it before becoming sick of it. Finished doesn’t need to mean polished either, not at the start.

## Helpful General Tips

- Learn how to use and read the manual. Links to both the GMS and GMS2 manuals are below in the Helpful Resource Section. Seriously, this is one of the most important things you can do. Keep it open, reference it, learn how to use it. 

- Use the Marketplace. There are free and relatively cheap assets (along with more expensive ones). Work through and understand how these work. Don't use them, even the best ones, as plug and play, understand how they work and adapt them.
Read the forum posts. Don’t just ask for help or answer questions. Read posts with questions you don’t know the answers to and problems you didn’t know could exist without comment. You can learn a lot just reading what other people write. There are also helpful tutorials on the forums tutorial page.

- Answer questions on the forum. It’s more than just a way to give back. It will help you. Dealing with other people’s code teaches you a lot of things, especially debugging, when it isn’t your code you’re trying to debug. For example, you’ll learn what type of code is easy for you to read and understand and how to problem solve. While I would strongly recommend against answering a question you don’t know the answer to, I do recommend occasionally trying to find the answer.

- Learn some math. Fortunately, or unfortunately, programming is heavily dependant on math. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division all occur on a very regular basis. Basic geometry, trigonometry, and algebra also occur. 

- Learn some logic. You will save yourself some major headaches if you internalize the proper use of logical expressions. 

- Don’t be afraid to look into other languages. GML is a great language, easy to use, and wonderful for making games. For this reason, pretty much every GML tutorial out there focuses on how to use GML to create games. Unfortunately, this means there aren’t a lot of GML tutorials that talk about the basics of how computers, and coding, work in general. While not necessary, people have made very successfully games without it, I found learning the basics of other languages to be extremely helpful. Also, understanding the basics of other languages (even if you couldn’t necessarily code in them) means that when you look for an answer to a problem, you can look outside of GML. 

- Learn about what it takes to make a game. This goes hand in hand with keep your first projects small. The more you know about what is actually required to make and release a game, the better idea you’ll have of what ‘small’ means. In the resource section, I’ve linked to several GDC talks from very small groups of people who created games with Game Maker Studio.

## Helpful Coding Tips

- Learn how to debug. Debugging, or more generally figuring out why something you thought should work isn’t, is probably one of the most useful skills you can learn after learning how to do something. You learn how to do something, then you try it, it doesn’t work, and you learn how to figure out why. Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good videos out there on debugging. At a minimum though, learn how to use the debugger and similar things (such as show_debug_message).

- Don't be afraid to think through a problem before you start coding. Don't be afraid to design the structure of what you want before you actually start working towards it. This includes not only big things like your game design as a whole, but small things like how you want your camera system to work.Break problems down into smaller problems. 

- If you don't know how to do something, try to break down the problem into smaller ones and solve those first.

- Use good variable names. You're going to re-read your code a lot. You might work with someone else or post code on the forum for help. The time you save typing short variable names isn't worth the time you or someone else will lose trying to understand your code later on.

- Be organized and consistent. The system you use doesn't matter as much as that you use a system. Use the same variable naming process and style, use folders to organize your sprites, scripts, and objects, etc.

- At some point, pick a code formatting style. Maybe not on day one, but at some point soon pick one that you like. I’ve been told that 80% of your interaction with code is re-reading what you or someone else wrote. If 80% of your time is going to be spent going over code, make your code easy to read and understandable. It’s also important if you’re going to ask for help on the forums as people are more likely to give responses if you post readable code.

- Generally speaking, be careful with built in variables. While many are useful, they often are connected to hidden processes you don't have control over. Make sure to read the manual and understand what they are connected to before using them. Not only will coding your own give you more control, but doing so will increase your understanding in general. Prime examples are alarms, speed, hspeed, vspeed, and all image variables. 

- Learn more about arrays and data structures. Arrays and the various GML data structures (list, grid, map, stack, queue, and priority queue) are very useful means of storing and handling both large and small amounts of data. Learning how and when to use each will expand the types of systems you can create.

- More advanced topics include buffers, surfaces, JSON, loading external resources, and shaders are all more advance topics. While probably not topics to start with, learning about these topics is a good way to expand your ability to code.

## Summary

 The above lists are so long that I will summarize everything here:
 
 - Have fun and stay motivated.
 
 - Keep coding.
 
 - Keep learning.

## Conclusion

Coding is fun, and making games is fun, I hope this helps you to do both.
